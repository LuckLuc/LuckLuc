The impact of global warming is massive because 
mankind is cutting and burning down these trees just so they can make profit.
Gloabal warming needs to end because people do this to make room for agriculture 
such as building manufactures and construction that ruins forests and their trees every year.
The forest is a home to many animals that play an important role in the ecosystem.
By burning down the trees, it leaves these organisms with no habitat. Around 30% of the world is made of forests and trees.
Humans near forests such as the people in Uganda need wood and other resources in the forest to survive.
This goes to show how much the forests make an impact on humans and other organisms.
The effects on the environment are drastic as well.
As a result of burning and cutting down trees in a forest, 
the trees that were cut down cause climate change because of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions.
20% of greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation
which is bad for the environment and other animals that live in the forests.
The effects of cutting down trees can also affect the water quality
coming from the forests that are used for drinking, 
agriculture and industries.
Since deforestation is affecting the water quality,
people that live near forests won’t be able to drink clean water and could get sick very easily.
Even though deforestation is currently happening, 
there are still ways to prevent a world where there won’t be any trees left.
